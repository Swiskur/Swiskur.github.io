<h2>About Me</h2>

<p id="aboutintro">Hello, my name is Schaefer Wiskur. I am 20 years old and I am a sophmore at Madonna University.
    I play baseball at Madonna and am a pitcher. I love baseball and have played my entire life. I especially enjoy the analytical side. I hope to
    pursue a job in baseball analytics in the future. I have had this dream ever since I watched the movie Moneyball. I am a Computer Science Major
    and a Sport Management & Mathematics dual minor. I plan to use this degree to fulfill my dream.
    In my free time outside of baseball I enjoy hunting, fishing, and buying & selling baseball cards.

 <h2>Favorite Hobby</h2>
    <br>
    <p id="aboutpara">My favorite hobby is collecting, buying, and selling sports cards. I have always collected baseball cards growing up.
        My dad got me into it from a young age as he had a couple of storage toats full of binders of cards. I would always get packs for Christmas
        and would be my favorite gift. I eventually discovered eBay where I began looking up values for my cards. I became fascinated with this and began
        buying and selling cards on eBay. It has really grown into a business for me. I sold so many cards this last year that eBay rated me as a top seller.
        I will also buy booths at card shows and sell cards there. I really enjoy this side hustle and find the cards and the process fun.
        I pretty much do specifically baseball cards, but am starting to branch into other sports, mainly Tom Brady cards. I have a personal collection that consists of 
        my favorite player Ivan Rodriguez, and my dad's favorite player Johnny Bench. I hope to keep growing my business and my collection in the future, I enjoy the hobby and plan
        to do this the rest of my life.
